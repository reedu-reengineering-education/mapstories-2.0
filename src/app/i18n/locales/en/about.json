  "tab1_text": "Mapstories was created as a collaboration between re:edu GmbH & Co.KG and Vamos e.V. The starting point of the project was to conduct a co-creative lab on the global clothing industry. Mapstories is a web-based open-source tool that allows students to independently engage in development education on the aforementioned topic. The Mapstories can be used in the context of education for sustainable development, particularly due to their ability to visually establish systemic connections, providing a comprehensive view of global issues.",
