<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node.js and Yarn installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/reedu-reengineering-education/next-13-tailwind-starter.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```
3. start development DB
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. migrate DB on first run
   ```sh
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. Run the App
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
### Setup of MinIO
For the image store [MinIO](https://min.io/) is used. After `docker-compose up -d` is run, go to `localhost:9000`. Login with the Name `minioadmin` and the password `minioadmin`. Navigate to buckets (on the left) and select `mapstories20`. There set the `Access Policy` to `public`. 

Next go to `Access Keys` and click `create access key` (at the top). Click `create` again and paste the `access key` and `secret key` to your `.env` file. An example is given in `.env.example`.
